# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Just started on Wes Bos's Javascript30. The first day project was fun, building a drum kit.

**Thoughts:** That exercise helped me brush on my JS a bit. Didn't get to work on as much CSS I was hoping to, but nonetheless I'm still making progress.

### Day 2: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played with some JS and CSS to create a clock.

**Thoughts**: I always catch myself tripping over the tiniest "bugs" like misspellings and punctuations. I definitely need to work on that. Overall I'm still pushing towards improvements.

### Day 3: August 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned some interesting CSS + some git commands.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to get familiar with CSS and the devtools. I was able to configure the sizes of the frame, blur and color. I would say thats pretty decent for an hour.

### Day 4: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I've decided to work on some fundamental JS, Array Methods.

**Thoughts**: I always thought Array methods were tedious. Worked on a bunch of Array exercises to get familiar with them. The following were Filter, Map, Sort, Reduce and a few other. Doing a bunch of repetitive exercises does help my Array phobia. Cheers to that.

### Day 5: August 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Topic for today was Api.

**Thoughts**: I've always struggled with creating one from scratch, let alone working with one. I started off tinkering with making HTTP requests, then customizing it, following up with handling errors. After that I did repetitions of callback functions. It's overwhelming at first, but I'm slowly easing into it.

### Day 6: August 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Callback Abstraction exercises and Callback Chaining.

**Thoughts**: Did some repetitions with callback abstraction and chaining. I must say, it's still out of my comfort zone. Each day I am improving with it nonetheless. Also managed to get the weather search working.

### Day 7: September 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Flex panel image gallery.

**Thoughts**: Continued working on some CSS and Js creating a flex panel. It was fairly easy getting familiar with it. I must confess, I'm still getting caught up with simple syntax errors.

### Day 8: September 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Object Property Shorthand and Destructuring

**Thoughts**: Honestly I don't know how I feel about this one, considering it's Node.js, I need more practice with this.

### Day 9: September 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Ajax Search

**Thoughts**: This little challenge right here allowed me to fiddle with Json data. Basically matching your word search with the data and highlighting it. There was a lot more Javascript than I thought, but it was a great exercise.

### Day 10: September 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Express, HTML, Static Assets, and Dynamic Pages with Templating.

**Thoughts**: This is a side project I'm working on for a weather app. I installed Express, which is an awesome framework for web and mobile. Created static assets and rendered it to multiple html pages. The project is half way there and I'm currently using Node.js for it.

### Day 11: September 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Array exercises

**Thoughts**: I did nothing but array exercises for today. Doing so does help me think of other ways to solve it and execute a lot faster.
