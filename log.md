# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Just started on Wes Bos's Javascript30. The first day project was fun, building a drum kit.

**Thoughts:** That exercise helped me brush on my JS a bit. Didn't get to work on as much CSS I was hoping to, but nonetheless I'm still making progress.

### Day 2: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
