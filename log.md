# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Just started on Wes Bos's Javascript30. The first day project was fun, building a drum kit.

**Thoughts:** That exercise helped me brush on my JS a bit. Didn't get to work on as much CSS I was hoping to, but nonetheless I'm still making progress.

### Day 2: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played with some JS and CSS to create a clock.

**Thoughts**: I always catch myself tripping over the tiniest "bugs" like misspellings and punctuations. I definitely need to work on that. Overall I'm still pushing towards improvements.

### Day 3: August 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned some interesting CSS + some git commands.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to get familiar with CSS and the devtools. I was able to configure the sizes of the frame, blur and color. I would say thats pretty decent for an hour.

### Day 4: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I've decided to work on some fundamental JS, Array Methods.

**Thoughts**: I always thought Array methods were tedious. Worked on a bunch of Array exercises to get familiar with them. The following were Filter, Map, Sort, Reduce and a few other. Doing a bunch of repetitive exercises does help my Array phobia. Cheers to that.
