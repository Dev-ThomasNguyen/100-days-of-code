# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Just started on Wes Bos's Javascript30. The first day project was fun, building a drum kit.

**Thoughts:** That exercise helped me brush on my JS a bit. Didn't get to work on as much CSS I was hoping to, but nonetheless I'm still making progress.

### Day 2: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played with some JS and CSS to create a clock.

**Thoughts**: I always catch myself tripping over the tiniest "bugs" like misspellings and punctuations. I definitely need to work on that. Overall I'm still pushing towards improvements.
